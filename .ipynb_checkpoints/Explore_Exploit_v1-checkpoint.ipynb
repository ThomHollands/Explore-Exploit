    "## Allocating Resources between exploration and exploitation -- a formal model\n",
    "This is an agent-based-model simulating a single firm interacting with an environment. The environment specifies an \"optimal\" enviromental strategy, and the firm has to \"decide\" on its own strategy. It needs to decide whether to stick or twist -- exploit its existing strategy, or explore new strategies, which may have a higher payoff. There are many periods to the simulation, and a certain amount of resources (the payoff) accrues to the firm (the agent) at the end of each period, depending on how closely its chosen strategy matches the environmental strategy."
